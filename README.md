## Market Segmentation Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Market Segmentation Analysis Project, developed as part of an advanced digital marketing course. The project explores customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to derive actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

### Project Overview

In this project, I analyze a dataset to identify distinct customer segments based on demographic, behavioral, and psychographic data. The insights gained aim to support marketing strategies and product recommendations tailored to specific customer groups.

### Key Features
Clustering Analysis: Implementation of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and K-means clustering to identify and visualize customer segments.
RFM Analysis: A comparative analysis of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics against the PCA K-means clusters to assess the importance of demographic and psychographic data.
Data Visualization: Creation of radar charts, violin plots, and bar charts to illustrate cluster characteristics and distributions effectively.
Objective
The goal of this project is to explore how advanced segmentation techniques can be leveraged to improve marketing outcomes.
